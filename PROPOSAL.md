# [Super Square Boy]

Author: [Alexander Marcozzi]

For my final project, I will be making a runner type game based heavily on the Impossible Game, which can be found at the following link: https://www.flukedude.com/theimpossiblegame/. Essentially, the player is a square and traverses the level from left to right. The only thing the player can do is jump; there is no horizontal movement control, just constant movement to the right and jumping. I am very excited to work on this project as the Impossible Game is one of my favorite games of all time.

An external library I plan to use is Choreograph by sansumbrella, which can be found here: https://github.com/sansumbrella/Choreograph. With this library, I hope to add animations for the square when the player jumps so the game looks less static, and for the title screen. This may change once I start actually working on the project, but for now, this is the only external library I have in mind.

During the first week, I plan to set the foundation for the game and implement the basic functionality. This includes simple left to right movement and jumping. Week 2 I am aiming to implement the first level, which I am thinking of storing in a text file. Week 3 I will add a title screen, colors, music, animations, and other mostly cosmetic things. If I have time, I will add additional levels and an attempts counter.
